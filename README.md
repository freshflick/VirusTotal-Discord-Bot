# VirusTotal-Discord-Bot
A Python-based Discord bot that makes scanning files easy and fast using the VirusTotal API — without ever leaving Discord.

## What it does:
- Upload any file to Discord, and the bot will automatically send it to VirusTotal for scanning.

- View detailed scan results directly in Discord, showing which antivirus engines detect the file as malicious, undetected, or unsupported.

- Use interactive buttons to easily navigate through multiple pages of scan results.

- Get a direct link to the full VirusTotal analysis for deeper insights, including community comments, file behavior, and technical details.

## Why I built it:
I built this bot to make it easier and faster to scan files shared in Discord servers. Usually, you would have to manually download a file, visit the VirusTotal site, upload it, and wait for results.
With this bot, everything happens inside Discord — saving time, improving server security, and making it more convenient for users to check files before opening them.
I also wanted to create a fun project using APIs and practice working with Discord bots, file handling, and API pagination.
